# Idea
Einstein is kind of hard-wired to DCU, School of Computing environment; e.g. authentication, modules, etc.

I would teach my classmates with the programming, mainly python.

I think there is too little Lab work in school, and it takes practice to become familiar with programming.

So, i wish to make an Einstein-Like Website, to check the correctness of Some specific programming problems.
